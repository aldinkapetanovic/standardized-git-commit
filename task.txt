Requirements


Imagine a scenario where you work on a collaborative project using Git for versioning files. To maintain clarity and organization within the project, you want to enforce a standardized commit message format.


You want to commit messages to be in the format:


: and to have a maximum of 50 characters.


As for the commit type, you offer:


    feature (new feature)
    fix (bug fix)
    refactor (refactoring code)
    wip (work in progress - commits to be pushed later)
    Solve this using Git hooks


Hint: use `commit-msg` hook.


Acceptance Criteria


    Create a public GitHub repository
    Add Readme explaining the solution
    Create required git-hook in this repository
